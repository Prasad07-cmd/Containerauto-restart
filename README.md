# Containerauto-restart
Get the container IP address only and Attach policy to the running container for auto start .

Conclusion :
Through this task, we successfully demonstrated the practical application of Docker container management using the eclipse/centos image. The two main objectivesâ€”capturing the IP address of a running container and ensuring a container restarts automatically after a system rebootâ€”were achieved using core Docker features.

In Task 1, we launched a container named dockerip and efficiently extracted its internal IP address using Docker inspection, storing it in the /tmp/address.txt file. This shows an understanding of Docker networking and inspection tools.

In Task 2, we deployed another container named ccaapp with the --restart unless-stopped policy, ensuring high availability by enabling automatic restarts upon system reboot. This highlights the ability to manage container lifecycle policies for production-like environments.
